*Programacion I*

</h3>

The Poet's Inn website was created as a project designed during the course of the subject __Programacion I__ of the Software Engineering career at __Universidad of Mendoza__. 

The objective of the project was to create a web page of poems in which we had to do a Full-Stack development incorporating both tools already known by the student as well as new ones seen during the course in 2022.

These are some of the working tools used:
